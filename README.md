# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## How to Load the website

You can load the website in two ways:
1. From this GitHub pages - open the [website](https://bschwarz.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
2. Download the [repo](https://github.com/bschwarz/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) locally - You can either download a zip file from the repo or you can clone the repo onto your local machine. Once downloaded onto your local machine, you can do one of two things to view:
-- Open the *index.html* file that is in the root directory of the repo, with a browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox).
-- Host the files through a local web server, and use your browser to navigate to the local web server. For example, if you have python installed, you can run this command in the root of the repo directory to serve the files: 

      ```
      python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 # assuming port 8080 is not used already.
      ```

   Then you can navigate your browser to *localhost:8080/*

If any tests fail, then they will appear in red. Tests that pass will be in green and are located at the bottom of the page.
